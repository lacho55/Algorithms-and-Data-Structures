<h1>Bubble Sort Algorithm</h1>

<p>Bubble sort is the simples sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements
it they are in wrong order.</p></br>

<p>This algorightm is suitable for small data sets</p></br>

<p> It is known as bubble sort, because with every complete iteration the largest element bubbles up
towards the last place or the highest index just like a water bubble rises up to the water surface</p></br>

<strong> Time complexity O(n^2) </strong></br>

<h1>How it works ? </h1>

<p> <strong>Step 1 - </strong> Starting with the first element(index = 0), compare
the current element with the next element of the array.</p>
<p> <strong>Step 2 - </strong> If the current element is greater than the next element
of the array, we swap them.</p>

<p> <strong> Step 3 - </strong> If the current element is less than the next element,
move the next element.</p>
<p> <strong> Step 4 - </strong> Repeat <strong>Step 1</strong> till the list is sorted </p>
